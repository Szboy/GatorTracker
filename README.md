# Gator Trackerssss
Welcome to our very nice and cool project.
## First time Set-up
1. Clone the repo using the cloning process of your choice (Mine is `git clone ssh`)
2. Once cloned, run `npm install`. This will install all the dependencies (There are a lot!)
3. Make sure you have MongoDB installed and working (I use v4.4 so I would recommed that, though any v4.x should work)

## Running the Appp
1. Start Mongo, once the app runs it will create a DB called GatorTracker at localhost (We can setup an Atlas DB at a later time)
2. Run `npm run dev` in one terminal in the project root folder (For Webpack hot-reloads)
3. Run `npm start` in another terminal in the project root folder (Starts the local server and connects to Mongo)
4. You should see the home page at `localhost:8000`!

## Contributing
I haven't really thought of a code style/syntaxal format. With that being said, I utilize `2` spaces so try to stick with that. As long as it is presentable it's fine. Also comment your code!
